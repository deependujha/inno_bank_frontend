          ‚û§ Most of us have felt that, we had a idea and we really believed in
          it. But, because of lack of funds we cannot make the product. Even
          though 98 of the 100 ideas won't succeed, but 98 lessons are
          important. And, the 2 ideas that will succeed will fill the void of 98
          failures.

            So, tackle the issues of lack of funds for innovation and solving

                    Since our bank is a non-profit Organization. So, only way for
                    bank to have money is through donations.

                  <li>
                    Anyone can donate in the bank, irrespective of the fact that
